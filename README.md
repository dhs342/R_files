- brazil.csv, brazil.rmd, Mexico_Merge.csv, mexico.rmd: These are associated R scripts and CSVs for my senior thesis. Each R script contains code for respective regressions and variable manipulations.

- al-2022-precinct-manipulate: After dataset cleanup, this is the end result for the 2022 Alabama Republican primaries.

- redo.rmd, all5_test.csv: Renamed some precincts due to inconsistent naming across Alabama primary years, and then merged al-2022 end product with other years to create a rough merge across all years.
